Concepts
    Flow as a consequence of Speed
    Computers are good at repetitive tasks; humans are not
    Think long term payoff; invest time now and reap rewards in productivity later (but soon!)

Tab expansion
    This should be like breathing; Use it constantly
    command names
    files
    directories
    press multiple times for a list of matches
    These become double checks for spelling

    set -o emacs, set -o vi
    word movement, substitution, etc

Builing a pipeline
    sleep 300 &

    awk '{print "some text " $2 " some more text " $3}'

        command
    done

    LIST
