Regex elements:

.               any character
+               appears one or more times
*               appears zero or more times
\d              digits
\s              whitespace (includes tabs)
\w              "word" characters
^               anchors to beginning of line
$               anchors to end of line
|               logical OR 
[char list]     type arbitrary single characters
[^char list]    same as above, but this is an exclude list
(backreference) matches here are referenced later with $1, $2, in order  


Examples:

/apple/         matches apple in any sequence of characters
/^apple/        matches apple, but only at beginning of line.
                badapple, for example, will not match.  Nor will "love apples"

/brian.+(apple|orange)/     What does this one do?
